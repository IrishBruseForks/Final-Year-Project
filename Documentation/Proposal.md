# Project Proposal

B.Sc. (Hons) in Software Development Applied Project & Minor Dissertation

**Student Name:** Ethan Conneely (G00393941) andRyan Harte (G00338424)

**Supervisor Name:** Gemma O'Callaghan

**Project Name:** AI-Integrated Messenger Application - (Ethryl) (Chatalyst) (ChitChat) (ChatCove) (GossipGrotto) (SpeakShack) (BanterBay) (LingoLagoon)

# Project Context:

Instant communication and the multitude of applications that provide such a service are used by a vast majority of the world's populace each day. Since the invention of the telephone communication has been evolving and with this continuous evolution in in technology, users are always seeking the next best ways in which they can communicate instantly.

With Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming more popular, there is a rising demand by users to access smarter, more intuitive, and user-friendly communication platforms. The reason for this is users want an application that can aid in automating, assisting and that enhances their interactions through the use of an AI-powered application.

## Proposed Solution:

As this is a group project, we aim to develop an instant messaging application (for both Desktop and Mobile Devices) that will have a strong focus on AI/Bot integration. The application will allow users to create an account, instant message/communicate, as well as send various multimedia files (mp3, mp4, gifs and many more) and interact and make use of the implemented bots and their various functions. See project objectives for more information.

# Project Objectives:

- **Development of a User-Friendly Interface (UI)**
  - **Overview:** Create a UI that is user friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
  - **Components:**
    - UI/UX to design the interface before implementation.
    - Responsiveness so the application responds in real time.
    - Theme customization. Light and Dark mode.

- **User customization capabilities**
  - **Overview:** Users can create, customise and delete their profiles.
  - **Components:**
    - Register an account.
    - Login/Logout.
    - Two Factor Authentication.
    - Profile customization, profile pictures etc...
    - Add/Remove Friends
    - Delete Account

- **Implement AI/Bots**
  - **Overview:** Implementation of AI/Bots to provide various services to users based on their capabilities.
  - **Components:**
    - Smart Reply Bot: Allows users to reply to messages through to use of a bots auto generated selection for quick and seamless replies.
    - News Bot: A bot that will give news to the user relevant to their location and interests.
    - Weather Bot: A bot that will tell users the weather at their location or a location of their choosing along with other relevant details.
    - Pokémon Bot: A funny Pokémon bot that will give a user relevant information on a Pokémon of their choosing. Will be a Pokédex bot essentially.
    - NSFW Bot: A bot that will filter an explicit content and make sure all content remains safe and user friendly.

- **Scalable Backend Infrastructure**
  - **Overview:** To build a robust backend using (enter DB here) that can handle the initial users of the application and those that could join in the future.
  - **Components:**
    - Optimised Database Queries: Essential to have the DB queries correctly implemented to avoid timeouts or deadlock states.
    - Database Selection: Making sure we are using the correct Database for scalability and that suits our applications purpose.

- **Issue/Bug Reports**
  - **Overview:** Build a system that users can use to report issues/bugs in the application via a UI.
  - **Components:**
    - Ticketing System: An efficient system that tracks and prioritizes issues/bugs based on severity.
    - Feedback Interface: A UI interface for reporting issues/bugs.

- Data Privacy/Security
  - Overview: User details remain private through encryption.
  - Components:
    - End to End Encryption: Ensure user conversations and private details remain encrypted.
    - Authentication:
      - Implement 2 factor authentication to keep users' data secure.
      - Email verification on all account setups.

# Technologies/System Architecture

Our AI-integrated messaging application will be developed using the following technologies and system architecture. system architecture:

**Frontend:**

- **React:** a popular JavaScript library known for its component-based structure, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- **MUI (Material-UI):** React components that adhere to Material Design principles, facilitating a consistent and "user friendly" user interface.

**Back-End:**

- **MongoDB** : a NoSQL database, implemented for its flexibility and scalability, especially suited for managing the dynamic structure of messaging data. Used to manage structured user data and application configurations, ensuring data integrity and relationships.
- **MySQL:** implemented for its flexibility and scalability, especially suited for managing the dynamic structure of messaging data. Used to manage structured user data and application configurations, ensuring data integrity and relationships.

**AI – Integration**

- The integration of AI capabilities, powered by leading-edge machine learning algorithms, enhances user experience by offering features such as smart replies, news and weather information and others as mentioned above. This combination of technologies ensures our application is scalable, responsive, and user-friendly, catering to the modern needs of messaging platforms and our target user audience.

# Schedule of work:

Our project employs the Agile Methodology 'Scrum'.

**JIRA**

- We have created a JIRA to organise our workload into 'sprints' and have created a Gannt Chart and Kanban board to keep our work organised and we can clearly see when project deadlines and goals are to be met/
